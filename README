# restmock

restmock is a server that serves mostly static content.  This content
is determined by a config file external to the server; restmock reads
this config file and generates a handler based off of it.

## Usage

Put your config file and any files that will be served by restmock in
$CONFIG_LOCATION.  This location will need to be on your classpath
when you run the server to be visible.

lein deps
lein uberjar
java -classpath $CONFIG_LOCATION:./restmock-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar restmock.core --config <default config.xml> --port <default 5000>

Because of how java -jar works (sets classpath to that in the
Manifest), it is not possible to run restmock with java -jar and still
have it properly read the configuration.

Configuration is specified by an XML file.  Paths are regular
expressions.  On match you can return static XML or JSON.

<xml>
  <routes>
    <route>
      <path>/foo</path>
      <text>foo</text>
    </route>
    <route>
      <path>/bar</path>
      <text>bar</text>
    </route>
    <route>
      <path>/person/([0-9]+)</path>
      <file>person.xml</file>
      <type>xml</type>
    </route>
  </routes>
</xml>

Files specified by your configuration also need to be accessible from
your classpath.
