# restmock

restmock is a server that serves mostly static content.  This content
is determined by a config file external to the server; restmock reads
this config file and generates a handler based off of it.

## Usage

Put your config file and any files that will be served by restmock in
$CONFIG_LOCATION.  This location will need to be on your classpath
when you run the server to be visible.

lein deps
lein uberjar
java -classpath $CONFIG_LOCATION:./restmock-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar restmock.core --config <default config.xml> --port <default 5000>

Because of how java -jar works (sets classpath to that in the
Manifest), it is not possible to run restmock with java -jar and still
have it properly read the configuration.
